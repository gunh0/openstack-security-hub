### Environment Setup

**Setup from `openstack/devstack`**

> <https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack>
>
> DevStack is a series of extensible scripts used to quickly bring up a complete OpenStack environment based on the latest versions of everything from git master. It is used interactively as a development environment and as the basis for much of the OpenStack projectâ€™s functional testing.
>
> ...
>
> Install Linux
>
> Start with a clean and minimal install of a Linux system. DevStack attempts to support the two latest LTS releases of Ubuntu, Rocky Linux 9 and openEuler.
>
> If you do not have a preference, **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)** is the most tested, and will probably go the smoothest.
